# React-SAP
I was instructed to create a Single Page Application (SPA) featuring multiple pages with navigation. This application includes a homepage, an about page, and a user profile page.
# Pages
#Homepage
You will find the landing pages, featuring key information and links to other sections.
#About Page
It is where you will find information about the application and its purpose.
#User Profile Page
You will find a personalized page displaying user-specific data and settings.
#Component
You will find a file of a navbar with the links of home,about and profile pages
